Write a tlstester in golang. The hostname:port passed will be a command line parameter, as well as timeout and number of retries. Returns certificate information including SAN attribute, protocol, cipher negotiated, and Root CA. If a specific TLS protocol or cipher (cipher will be declared in golang tls/crypto format) is passed in the command line, they will be used to test connectivity. As an option, a trusted keystore can be manually supplied as an argument, as well as an option to bypass chain of trust checks.
